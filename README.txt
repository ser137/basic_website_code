stylesheet.css
'sets the scene' so to speak. the colours of paint that will be used **


index.html
how the scene is presented. how to paint using the colours given by the stylesheet


BWmain.js
javascript code for serial presentation of images as defined by a user button press. how the user can change the paint colours, so to speak



** for some reason, the layout goes to shit when i try to present an image with portrait orientation. any input on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated : ))
